# Inclusive Job Portal

## Project Summary

This platform connects job seekers with supportive, inclusive employers, with a special focus on individuals who are neurodivergent (such as those with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, or speech differences), without labeling or limiting them.

Instead of being a “neurodivergent-only” site, the platform uses a **skill-first, user-controlled disclosure** approach to ensure fairness, flexibility, and a broader range of opportunities.

## Core Principles

- **Skill-Based Matching:** Emphasizes candidates’ skills, portfolios, and assessments rather than personal or medical histories.
- **Optional Disclosure:** Users are not required to disclose neurodivergence and can choose when or if to share personal needs.
- **Inclusive Employer Network:** Only companies committed to inclusive hiring practices may post jobs and specify available accommodations.
- **Support Without Stigma:** Provides anonymous resources such as interview prep, wellness guides, and productivity tools.
- **Label the Workplace, Not the Person:** Employers’ listings include environment markers (e.g., “neurodivergent-friendly,” “flexible hours”) without tagging applicants.
